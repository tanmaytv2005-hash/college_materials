Program 9: Develop a Program in C for the following operations on Singly Circular 
                      Linked List(SCLL) with header nodes
a.	Represent and Evaluate a Polynomial P(x,y,z)=6x2y2z-4yz5+3x3yz+2xy5z-2xyz3
b.	Find the sum of two polynomials POLY1(x,y,z) and POLY2(x,y,z) and store the result in POLYSUM(x,y,z)
       Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above   
       operations.



Polynomial (x,y,z)=6x2y2z-4yz5+3x3yz+2xy5z-2xyz3
If x=y=z=1,
Result= 5

Polynomial 1=     5x3y3z3+4 x2y z5+7xy4z6

Polynomial 2=     4x3y3z3+ 8xyz
