Program 11:Develop a Program in C for the following operations on Graph(G)of  
           Cities
a)	Create a Graph of N cities using Adjacency Matrix.
b)	Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph using DFS/BFS method


Output:

1.Create Graph
2.BFS Traversal
3.DFS Traversal
4.Exit
Enter your choice: 1

Enter the number of vertices of the graph: 5

Enter the adjacency matrix of the graph:
0  1  1  1  0
0  0  0  1  1
0  0  0  1  0      
0  0  0  0  1
0  0  0  0  0

 


1.Create Graph
2.BFS Traversal
3.DFS Traversal
4.Exit
Enter your choice: 2

Enter the source vertex : 0

 Nodes that are reachable from  source node 0

The reachable vertices are: 1	2	3	4
